# compism-rfcs
Project is named `compism`, which can be explained as `just Completed dIsaSseMbler` or
`COMposItion-ism`. The first word means we only plan to finish a "completed" but not guaranteed
disassembler. The second one means we truly want our project to be compositional. This will 
heavily influence our basic design.

This is the RFC repository, for more information, please refer to
[RFC-0](/rfcs/0-basic-project-info.md).
