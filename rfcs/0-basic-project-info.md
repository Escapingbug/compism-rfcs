# Summary

This is an RFC to provide the basic information for project `compism` and the management of this
project is also provided.

# Motivation

Provide overall information and project management strategy is no harm to a new project. This
process heavily influences the enthusiasm of all project team members and is better for project
management when there are more and more people joining this interesting project.

# Detailed Design

## Project Name and Meaning
Project is named `compism`, which can be explained as `just Completed dIsaSseMbler` or
`COMposItion-ism`. The first word means we only plan to finish a "completed" but not guaranteed
disassembler. The second one means we truly want our project to be compositional. This will 
heavily influence our basic design.

## Project Management
Project will be using RFC-based design process management. Anyone who has a new design thought
can open a pull request with a new RFC file describing the design. The number 0 RFC file can be
used as a template. Each RFC's file name should have a prefix number as RFC number. RFC file can
be updated, history can be viewed in history commits.

## Community
IRC is the prefered way of asking questions. Issues are prefered way to report bugs or discuss an
first-stage design thought. 

English is the main language on github discussion. Feel free to use other languages to ask questions
if you are having a hard time using English, but your questions can only be answered when somebody
understands. If you really know nothing about English, you can open issues or pull-requests on
github but with a google translated copy attached(original text must be provided in case google
dosen't translate clearly and for those who understands the language).

## About `README.md`
The information in `README.md` heavily depends on this file. Be sure to change that as well every
time you make changes to this file.

# Alternatives
Project info must be provided. No alternatives

# Unresolved questions
More information can be provided along the process. That being said the file will be changed
frequently.
